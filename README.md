# 🌌 Firefly Synchronization Simulation

A mesmerizing simulation of how **fireflies synchronize their blinking** — inspired by one of nature's most beautiful and mathematically fascinating phenomena.

## 🎯 Purpose & Ambition

This project is part of my **Waves and Oscillations** coursework. My ambition was to go beyond traditional theory and **visually demonstrate synchronization** — a phenomenon where simple individual units (like fireflies) gradually align their rhythms just by interacting with neighbors.

Inspired by **real-world biological systems**, I wanted to simulate:
- Collective synchronization (Kuramoto model concept)
- Natural 3D visual effects
- Sound-enhanced immersive experience
- A modern interactive demo using **p5.js** and **WebGL**

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Natural Firefly Logic** – Each firefly has its own rhythm but slowly adjusts based on nearby fireflies.
- 🌐 **3D Environment** – View a glowing swarm in an immersive space.
- 💓 **Heartbeat Soundtrack** – Optional ambient heartbeat to highlight the emotional and rhythmic aspect of synchronization.
- 📊 **Sync Meter** – See how synchronization evolves over time.
- 🔁 **Autoplay & Loop** – Watch synchronization unfold automatically.

## 📽️ How It Works

Each firefly:
- Has its own **phase** and **timer**
- Blinks when its internal phase hits a threshold
- Slightly adjusts phase based on nearby blinks
- Over time, **global synchronization** emerges ✨

This is a visual approximation of **coupled oscillators**, related to the **Kuramoto model**.
